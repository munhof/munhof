## My current Work

Now i'm currently working on:

### [PerdÃ­ mis puntos y mis mayÃºsculas: ](https://github.com/munhof/perdi-mis-mayusculas-y-mi-puntos)

In June 2025, during a Machine Learning course, we encountered the classic Natural Language Processing problem of truecasing and punctuation restoration. Alongside a group of classmates, we built a model to address this challenge. I'm currently working on improving the model's accuracy and robustness.

### [Â¿Podre mudarme?](https://github.com/munhof/podre_mudarme)

This seemingly simple question touches on deep social and economic issues in Argentina. After years of economic instability, global crises, and changing housing conditions, many young workers are asking: Can I afford to move out?
Combining web scraping, statistics, machine learning, and coffee, I'm exploring ways to answer this question.
